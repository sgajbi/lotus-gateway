## Advisor-Brief Runtime Context Extraction

- Scope: behavior-preserving advisor-brief service modularity and CI ratchet enforcement.
- Existing owner pattern: `AdvisorBriefService` remains the orchestration facade; source context,
  narrative shaping, workflow-pack runtime mapping, supportability loading, and client protocols
  are owned by focused advisor-brief service modules.
- Change: moved runtime evidence loading into
  `src/app/services/advisor_brief_runtime_context.py` and kept public advisor-brief response and
  review-action behavior unchanged.
- Measured signal: `src/app/services/advisor_brief_service.py` reduced from 438 to 397 lines;
  largest source file is now `src/app/services/performance_workspace_service.py` at 437 lines;
  longest function remains 49 lines.
- CI enforcement: blocking refactor threshold ratcheted from `438/49` to `437/49`; `437` passes
  and `436` fails only on `src/app/services/performance_workspace_service.py`.
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_advisor_brief_service.py` preserves runtime behavior and
  `tests/unit/test_service_layer_boundaries.py` now pins runtime-context ownership.
- Follow-up: next measured modularity slice should inspect
  `src/app/services/performance_workspace_service.py` before changing code.
